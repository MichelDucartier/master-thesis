\section*{\ackname}

Begin by thanking your thesis supervisor and describing their role in shaping this digital health project. Thank medical partners and healthcare professionals who provided domain expertise or facilitated data access. Acknowledge technical team members who assisted with AI/ML development or data analysis. Thank those who helped with data annotation, validation, or clinical interpretation. If relevant, acknowledge the healthcare institutions that collaborated in the study. Mention any funding or computational resources that supported this work.

\section*{Data and code availability}

Specify where and how verified researchers can access the protected health data used in this study. Describe the data-sharing agreements and authentication process required. For synthetic or anonymized datasets, provide repository information. Document where to find the relevant code, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation scripts while excluding any sensitive parameters. Include contact information for data access requests. State which components are openly available versus restricted due to privacy concerns.

\section*{Ethical considerations}

State all medical ethics committee approvals obtained for working with patient data. Document compliance with health data protection regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, \etc). Describe the data anonymization protocols implemented. Explain measures taken to protect patient privacy throughout the AI development pipeline. Detail the informed consent process if direct patient participation was involved. Address potential biases in the medical AI system and any steps taken to mitigate them. Include ethics committee protocol numbers and approval dates.
