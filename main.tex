% Authors and supervisors
%
% As a rule of thumb, junior authors (students) should be listed first, ordered by
% their contribution or alphabetically if contributions are equal. They should be
% followed by senior authors (supervisors), with the most senior supervisor, typically
% the main thesis supervisor or Principal Investigator (PI) and often a professor, listed last.
% This ordering reflects the contribution hierarchy and is standard practice in academic writing.
